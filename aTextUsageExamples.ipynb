    "Analytsis of Text (aText) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) package developed over many years using machine and deep learning and symbolic AI techniques. The full aText package implements the most fundamental aspects of deep linguistics processing as listed below. Many real-world applications have been written using the functionalities of aText, including legal contract verification and documents classification, investors sentiment analysis, call center chat sentiment analysis with embedded acoustic features, semantic search for accurate documents retrieval, translation of natural language query to SQL, image captioning, and extraction of information about competitive asset managers. Patents on several proprietary algorithms implemented in the package are pending.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine and deep learning:\n",
    "- supervised document classications (NBC, kNBC, SVM, Fisher Kernel)\n",
    "- unsupervised classifications and topic modeling (LSA, pLSA, LDA)\n",
    "- deep learning models based on RNN/LSTM and word2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguistics processing:\n",
    "- parsing (tokenization, stemming, POS tagging)\n",
    "- named-entity extraction and co-reference resolution\n",
    "- subject-verb-object triple extraction\n",

    "Web and social media:\n",
    "- sentiment and social network analyses\n",
    "- text summarization at the sentence and clauses levels\n",
    "- web-scraping (e.g. Amazon and TripAdvisor) of reviews\n",
    "- social media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) and email analyses\n",
    "\n",
    "The original package has been written in platform-independent Java with a graphical user interface. For developers, aText functionalities have been made accessible via APIs to the jar file. A Python wrapper has been added to expose most of the functions for data scientists and engineers. The code in this notebook file provides the following example basic usage of the package aText - basic sentiment analysis, document classification via Naive Bayesian Classifer (NBC), and sentence-level summarization.\n",

    "INSTALLATION\n",
    "\n",
    "- Execute \"pip install atext\"\n",
    "- Requirements: Java 1.8 installed, packages py4j and requests, 350MB of space in the Python package directory.\n",
    "- Download data files from the githb repository: https://github.com/sjskdas/aText\n",
    "\n",
    "ISSUES:\n",
    "- If an invalid or corrupt jar file error occurs then download the jar file from this location and then copy to the aText directory under python site-packages: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ajhdrxw3n-I6OE1nODdp6W0DbuW6aImb\n",
    "- If a permission error occurs when opening the example notebook file then start jupyter notebook as an administrator.\n",

    "This scenario is an example of how the world is changing when it comes to managing electronic information. In the future, books and magazines will be used only for special purposes, as electronic documents become the primary means of storing, accessing, and sorting written communication. As many fields become overwhelmed with information, it will become physically impossible for any individual to process all the information available on a particular topic. Massive amounts of data will reside in cyberspace, generating demand for text mining technology and solutions.\\\n",
    "Text mining has been defined as “the discovery by computer of new, previously unknown, information by automatically extracting information from different written resources”. The Dow-Union Carbide scenario reflects how text mining can be applied in practical business situations. Many other domains (such as health care, government, education, and manufacturing) can also benefit from text-mining tools. Here, we explore them to guide organizations looking for the most effective solutions.\\\n",
    "Text mining is similar to data mining, except it is designed to handle structured data from databases or XML files, working with unstructured or semistructured data sets (such as email, full-text documents, and HTML files). As a result, text mining is a much better solution for companies (such as Dow) where large volumes of diverse information must be merged and managed. To date, however, most research and development efforts have centered on data mining using structured data.\\\n",
    "Machine intelligence is a problem for text mining. Natural language has developed to help humans communicate with one another and record information. Computers are a long way from comprehending natural language. Humans are able to distinguish and apply linguistic patterns to text, overcoming obstacles (such as slang, spelling variations, and contextual meaning). Computers do not handle them easily. Meanwhile, although our language capabilities allow us to comprehend unstructured data, we lack the computer’s ability to process text in large volumes at high speeds. The key to text mining is creating technology that combines a human’s linguistic capabilities with the speed and accuracy of a computer. \\\n",
